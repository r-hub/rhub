```

In this article you'll learn how to use `rhub` to connect to the R-hub 
builder API to start new checks and get the results and artifacts of recent 
checks.

```{r}
library(rhub)
```


## Validate your email address

To build and check packages, first you need to validate your email address with
`validate_email()`.

![](figures/email-validation.png)

The package tries to detect your email address using [`whoami`](https://github.com/r-lib/whoami#whoami) 
(note that `whoami` does so using your global git config)
and the maintainer email listed in DESCRIPTION; and if it fails to do this
correctly, you'll need to specify it. This means that if running `validate_email()` 
gives an error, you should either run `validate_email("youremail@example.com")` (
quickest fix), or edit your global git config (less quick, but useful for 
package development in general; to set it up smoothly 
[refer to this `usethis` helper](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#configure-user-name-and-user-emails)). 

`rhub` stores the token permanently on the machine, so you do not need
to validate your email again. You can also copy your token to other
machines: run `list_validated_emails()` to get the token, and use the 
`validate_email()` function on the new machine, using both the `email` and
 `token` arguments.

Currently you cannot use the token obtained via this function in the Web
UI of the R-hub builder.

## Run a package check

`check()` runs an `R CMD check` on the package in the specified directory,
or specified source R package tarball created by `R CMD build` or
`devtools::build()`. It defaults to the working directory.

```r
check()
```

If the `platform` argument is NULL, and the R session is interactive, then 
a menu is shown. If it is NULL, and the session is not interactive, then the
default R-hub platform `platforms()$name[1]`, i.e. `r platforms()$name[1]`,
is used.

In interactive R sessions, the output of the check is printed to
the screen unless you set the `show_status` argument to `FALSE`. Therefore, 
by default, your R session is busy showing the log until the check is finished, 
so set `show_status` to `FALSE` if you want to submit a check and then go on 
with your work in the same session.

In all cases, you will receive a notification email with results after the check.

![recording of a check on a screen](figures/check-output.gif)

You can either just run the function, or assign its output to an object, that 
you can use to print results to the screen, to browse the web page of the check, 
and to retrieve URLs to the web page of the check but also to its artifacts 
that are kept a few days.

```r
mycheck <- check()
mycheck$browse()
mycheck$print()
mycheck$livelog()
mycheck$urls()
```

To retrieve such objects from previous checks, see [the corresponding section](#browse-previous-checks).

## Select a building and checking architecture

You can run checks on any platform. You can use the platform ids (e.g. `"debian-gcc-devel"` 
or `c("debian-gcc-devel", "debian-gcc-patched")`) to select between platforms. 
You should not run checks on all platforms at once. E.g. if preparing for a
CRAN submission, use the shortcut function `check_for_cran()` that will submit
your package to a few recommended platforms. The following subsections give
more info on how to select platforms.

### Listing R-hub platforms

If looking for a platform with particular characteristics, in 
particular to reproduce a result from CRAN's own platform, have a look at the
R-hub platform characteristics.

```{r platforms-info}
knitr::kable(platforms(), row.names = FALSE)
```

### Shortcuts for quick checks

These are quick shortcuts that select the right platform(s):

* `check_on_linux()` and `check_on_windows()` select the operating system.
* `check_on_debian()`, `check_on_ubuntu()`, `check_on_fedora()` and
  `check_on_centos()` select an appropriate Linux platform.
* `check_on_solaris()` also selects an operating system, Solaris, and by 
default checks neither vignettes nor manual (`--no-manual --no-build-vignettes`).
* `check_with_roldrel()`, `check_with_rrelease()`, `check_with_rpatched()`
  and `check_with_rdevel()` select an R version.
* `check_for_cran()` runs checks on platforms that are closest to platforms used by CRAN on submission:
    * Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran,
    * Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC,
    * Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32⁄64 bit,
    * and, if your package needs compilation, Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC ASAN/UBSAN.
You can run `default_cran_check_platforms:::default_cran_check_platforms(<package-path>)` to find out which 
platforms will be selected for your package.
* `check_with_valgrind()` runs the build and check on Linux, in `valgrind`
  to find memory leaks and pointer errors.
* `check_with_sanitizers()` runs all package package tests, examples and
  vignettes with Address Sanitizer and Undefined Behavior Sanitizer, see
  below.

### Sanitizers for compiled code

R-hub provides a special Docker image to run Address Sanitizer (ASAN) and
Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSAN). This is based on the `r-devel-san`
image of the [Rocker project](https://github.com/rocker-org/r-devel-san).

This image does not run `R CMD check` at all, but it runs

1. package tests,
2. all manual examples, and
3. all vignette code

with ASAN and UBSAN enabled. Use it via `check_with_sanitizers()`.

## Browse previous checks

Once a check is finished (or failed), you will get a notification email but 
you can also get information from R. E.g. you could submit a check for a 
package located at `<package-path>`, then turn off your computer and on the following days retrieve results
via 

```r
previous_checks <- rhub::list_package_checks(<package-path>,
                                  email = "maelle.salmon@yahoo.se",
                                  howmany = 4)
previous_checks
```

```r
# A tibble: 10 x 13
   package version result group   id      platform_name build_time

# … with 6 more variables: submitted <dttm>, started <dttm>, platform <list>,
#   builder <chr>, status <rhub::status>, email <chr>
```

You can then extract checks from this list using their `group` ID (ID for 
checks submitted simultaneously e.g. via `check_for_cran()`) or `id` (check id).
 In both cases you'll get a `rhub_check` object.

Here's an example where we extract the last group of checks, print it to the 
screen, and query its URLs. 

```r
group_id <- previous_checks$group[1]
group_check <- rhub::get_check(group_id)
group_check
```

We could similarly extract the last check.

```r
check_id <- previous_checks$id[1]
rhub::get_check(check_id)
```

## Prepare a CRAN submission

First, run `check_for_cran()` and assign the result to an object (or retrieve 
the results from a previous `check_for_cran()` submission by its `group` ID 
as shown in the previous subsection). Then once the checks are done, 
use the `cran_summary()` method to get a message that you can copy-paste in 
your cran-comments.md file (created via e.g. `usethis::use_cran_comments()`).

```r
cran_prep <- check_for_cran()
cran_prep$cran_summary()
